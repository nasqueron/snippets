## Snippets

Those snippets can be used as starting block for applications
and configuration files.

They're general purpose and can be used for any project,
but headers and codestyle are customized for Nasqueron.

### Tips

Trailing spaces have been added when you need to add informtation,
you can start immediately after the last space. This method allows
you to check with `git diff` if all has been filed: the UI will highlight
any trailing space, so it means you forgot to add information there.

Beware when committing changes NOT to remove those trailing spaces.

### Snippets or library?

If code belongs to a library, it's probably best to create or improve
one of our core libraries, like:

  - Limiting Factor: Rust helper methods to build API
  - Keruald Omnitools: PHP utilities library
